# Umair Khan - Portfolio Website

i'm a fresh Computer Science graduate with an insatiable appetite for AI and Machine Learning. While my degree from Kamla Nehru Institute is new, my passion for pushing tech boundaries has been brewing for years. I don't just see algorithms; I see solutions to real-world puzzles.

My journey has led me through diverse AI landscapesâ€”from teaching machines to detect online toxicity to predicting financial crises. Recent internships at Spacept and Ybi Foundation weren't just jobs, but playgrounds where I upgraded ML systems and breathed life into inference models as I embark on my professional path, I'm not just seeking employment; I'm on a quest to contribute to the AI revolution. Armed with Python and frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I'm ready to transform complex data into intelligent solutions.

My toolkit includes a solid foundation in computer vision, NLP, and data analysis, complemented by a knack for problem-solving and an eagerness to learn. I thrive on challenges that push me to expand my skills and knowledge.

If you're looking for a blend of fresh perspective and tech enthusiasm, let's connect. Together, we could shape the future of AI, turning data into insights and ideas into innovations. Ready to explore the possibilities?
